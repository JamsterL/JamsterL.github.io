## Instruction  

#### Step 1: Format your resume by markdown editor  
1. Firstly, we need to use word processor to write our resume. This is my word format resume:

2. Secondly, we need to transfer our word format resume to markdown format. The Markdown editor that I use is MarkdownPad. This editor is a specialized text editor for Markdown. Also, it is the best Markdown editor that Etter's book mentioned. Under *More Resources*, I post the Markdown tutorial to help you learn how to use it. In addition, my Markdown format resume is under *Prerequisites*.  

##### The concept in Etter's book  
* "Use Lightweight Markup" is explained in this step. We use Markdown because it is a lightweight markup. That is easy to write and edit. In Etter's book, there is another way to do this, that is XML. When writing the same thing by XML and Markdown, XML will use four times more number of characters than Markdown. We should use lightweight markup to write our resume more simply to achieve the same effect.
#### Step 2: Update your resume to github  
After writing our resume by Markdown, we need to host our resume to github. There are several step to do it:  
1. Register your github account.  
2. Creat a new repository by **new** button(in the upper left corner, a green button).  
3. Write username.github.io in *repository name*.  
4. Click **Create repository**.  
5. Update your resume in index.md.  
6. Write a Readme.md to tell people what file you did.

After that, your resume will host online successfully. Additionally, you can use [github desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to modify your resume locally. I post the tutorial for using github desktop under *More Resources*.  

##### The concept in Etter's book  
This step explained "Use Distributed Version Control". Git uses distribute version control, many people can work on the same project more efficiently. People can modify the project locally by github desktop or else.   

#### Step 3: Download a theme for your resume   
In this step, we can get a theme that you want by Jekyll.  
1. Download [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)  
2. Go to [Jekyll theme](http://jekyllthemes.org/) Website.  
3. Pick the theme you like and go to the homepage.  
4. There is a tutorial for how to install this theme.  
5. Enter username.github.io in the URL bar to view your resume.  

##### The concept in Etter's book  
This step is related to "Make Static Websites". The static website is good for speed, simplicity, portability and security, and we can host static website practically anywhere.The one of popular tools to make static wesite is Jekyll. We can use it to create a beautiful, functional documentation website.

## FAQs
1. **Why is Markdown better than a word processor?**  
Markdown can present rich text layout effects but is lighter than word processor, and Markdown can keep updated online.  
  
2. **Why is my resume not showing up?**  
Sometimes github page is slow to process, and it only needs to be refreshed a few times.
